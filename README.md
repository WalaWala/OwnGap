OwnGap
================================
A native replacement for the HTML canvas. It executes JavaScript as code behind with the V8 engine.
Currently made for the impact.js engine, but should work with other engines as well. There is an Ouya-specific
controller used, but this could easily be removed. 

TODO
--------------------------------
- [x] JavaScript loop with timeouts and intervals
- [x] Image drawing/rendering
- [x] Short Audio clips (longer music is currently not supported)
- [ ] Canvas image rotation/transformation/alpha 
- [ ] Touch support (sooner or later)
- [ ] Add examples
